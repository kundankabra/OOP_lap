# **Object-Oriented-Programming**

OOP Assignments: 

>**ASSIGNMENT-1** :

-To understand concept of static member function , friend function ,inline function and dynamic  memory allocation.etc. 
-Name, Roll number, Class, division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, telephone number, driving license no Etc.
 Construct the database with suitable member functions viz  , static member functions, friend class/ friend function, this pointer, 
 inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete. 
 Implement all the keywords as mentioned in the problem statement.
<hr> 

>**ASSIGNMENT-2** : 

-To use operator overloading concept to perform different operations on complex numbers.
-Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. 
 Implement the following operations: 
  1) Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i). 
  2) Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers. 
  3) Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex number
<hr>  

>**ASSIGNMENT-3** :

-To understand concept of inheritance.
-Implement c++  program to create a base class called shape . Use this  class to store two double type values that could be used to compute the area of figures.
  Derive two specific classes called  function get_data() to initialize base    
  Class data members and another member function display_area() to compute and display area of figures.
  Make classes to suit their requirements . Using  these three  classes , design a program that will accept dimmesion of a triangle or a rectangle 
  interactively and display the area . Remember the two treated as lengths of two sides in the case of rectangle and as base and height in the case 
  of triangles and used as follows:
    Area  of rectangle=x*y;
    Area of triangle=1/2*X*Y;
 <hr>   

>**ASSIGNMENT-4** :

-To understand concept of template function.
-Write function template and class template selection sort . Write a program that inputs , sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.
<hr>

>**ASSIGNMENT-5** : 

-To understand concept of exception as well as user defined exception.
-User defined exception to check the following conditions and throw the exception if the criterion does not meet.
  A. User stays in Pune/Mumbai/Bangalore/Chennai.
  B. User has 4-wheeler city , vehicle from the user and check for the conditions mentioned above .if any of the condition not met then throw the exception .
     if user does not enter proper input throw the exception.
 <hr>    

>**ASSIGNMENT-6** : 

-To create a class template to represent a generic vector.
-Create a class template to represent a generic vector. Include following member functions:
  i.  To create the vector.
  ii. To modify the value of a given element 
  iii.To multiply by a scalar value
  iv. To display the vector in the form (10,20,30,…)
<hr>

>**ASSIGNMENT-7** : 

-To create a standard template library for performing certain operations.
-Using standard template library (STL) list container implement following member functions of list class: empty, insert, reverse, sort, Unique, using iterator."
<hr>

>**ASSIGNMENT-8** : 

-To create an output file to perform file related operations.
-Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file and open it again as an input file and read the information 
 from the file.
